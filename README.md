## Project Architecture

### API Connection Class

A dedicated class has been implemented to manage the connection to the ExchangeRate-API. This class utilizes the
standard `java.net.HttpURLConnection` library to establish secure HTTP connections and send GET requests to the API URL.

### Gson Library Usage

For processing JSON data received from the API, the project makes use of the Gson library. This tool easily converts
JSON objects to Java objects and vice versa, facilitating data manipulation in the project.

### Data Storage Class

Additionally, a specific class has been designed for storing conversion data. This class records all conversions made
during the current user session, enabling quick and efficient access to the transaction history.
